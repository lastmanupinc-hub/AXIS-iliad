// VENDORED from the AXIS Launch repo: packages/axis-seo@0.1.0 (2026-08-08).
//
// WHY A COPY LIVES HERE. apps/web's prerender wiring (3771206) originally
// depended on it via `"@axis/seo": "file:../../../AXIS Launch/packages/axis-seo"`
// - a path OUTSIDE this repository. That broke every fresh clone and every CI
// container (ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE -> 3 consecutive red runs on main), and
// left a rogue npm package-lock.json inside a pnpm workspace. A repo must be
// self-contained to be buildable; a file: dependency into a sibling checkout
// never is.
//
// Only the closure this repo actually consumes is vendored: the vite plugin,
// schema.ts + config.ts it imports, and schema.test.ts so the vendored code
// keeps its coverage. The full axis-seo package (React components, audit) stays
// in AXIS Launch - if it is ever published to npm, delete this directory and
// depend on the published version.
//
/**
 * config.ts — the entity graph, as configuration.
 *
 * Everything the package emits is derived from one object you define once. The
 * point is that a person/organization identity is repeated across dozens of
 * pages and several sites, and the value comes from those repetitions being
 * *byte-identical*. Search engines reconcile entities by matching strings and
 * links; drift between "Jane Q. Example" and "Jane Example" splits one strong
 * entity into two weak ones.
 *
 * So: define it here, import it everywhere, never retype it.
